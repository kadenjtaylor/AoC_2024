# Advent of Code 2024

## Wait, isn't this being started in August 2025? 

Sure is :) I was planning/executing a move at the time, and I'm now starting the job search again. This is a way for me to make sure my skills are still sharp while I do all the applying, interviewing, etc. Plus, I do love these puzzles.

## Usage

```bash
# runs last day in the list
$ mill problems.run 
```

```bash
 # runs all days in order
$ mill problems.run all
```

```bash
 # runs day #i (index i + 1)
$ mill problems.run {i}
```
